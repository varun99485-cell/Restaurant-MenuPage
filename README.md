Frontend of a Restaurant Menu Page

## 2. Project Objective
The objective of this project is to design and develop a responsive, visually appealing, and user-friendly restaurant menu website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website displays food items category-wise and allows users to filter menu items dynamically.

## 3. Project Description
This project is a frontend-only restaurant menu web application. It displays various food items offered by a restaurant under different categories such as Starters, Main Course, Desserts, and Beverages.

The project was built to understand the basics of frontend web development and to learn how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create an interactive user interface. Instead of displaying a static menu, this project allows users to filter menu items based on categories, making it more user-friendly.
